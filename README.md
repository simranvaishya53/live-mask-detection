# Live Mask detection using Laptop or Mobile Cam.

Built a robust model for mask detection using transfer learning(VGG19) and HaarCascade.
Successfully achieved an accuracy of 98%.
Haarcascade classifier was used to detect the faces and get the bounding boxes across face. Which was further feed into model to classify into mask and not mask labels.
